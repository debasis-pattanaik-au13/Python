# Steve wants to reduce s as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and printing sâ€˜s non-reducible form!

# Note: If the final string is empty, print Empty String.

# Input Format:- A single string, s.

# Constraints
# 1<=n<=100

# Output Format:- If the final string is empty, print Empty String; otherwise, print the final non-reducible string.
